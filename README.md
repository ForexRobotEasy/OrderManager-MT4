This code implements a risk management feature that allows traders to define the risk associated with each trade accurately and quickly. It also provides a visual representation of potential risks to aid traders in making informed decisions. Additionally, it includes an order modification function that streamlines the process for traders. The order modification feature is easy to use and incorporates advanced trading tools. Trade functions necessary to optimize risk management and order modification are also developed.

## Risk Management

The `CalculateRisk` function calculates the lot size based on the risk percentage and stop loss provided. It uses the formula: `AccountBalance() * riskPercentage / stopLoss` to calculate the lot size.

The `VisualizeRisk` function displays the risk information visually using the `Comment` function. It shows the risk percentage, stop loss, and the calculated lot size based on the risk percentage and stop loss.

## Order Modification

The `ModifyOrder` function modifies an existing order by updating the stop loss and take profit levels. It uses the `OrderModify` function to modify the order with the new stop loss and take profit levels.

## Trade Functions

The `OpenOrder` function opens a new order with the specified parameters. It uses the `OrderSend` function to send the order with the symbol, type, lots, stop loss, and take profit.

The `CloseOrder` function closes an existing order. It uses the `OrderClose` function to close the order with the ticket, order lots, and current bid.

## Main Program

The `OnStart` function is the main program that executes the risk management and order modification functions. It first defines the risk percentage and stop loss parameters. Then, it calculates and visualizes the risk using the `VisualizeRisk` function.

Next, it opens a new order with the specified parameters using the `OpenOrder` function. It calculates the lot size based on the risk percentage and stop loss.

After that, it modifies the order by calling the `ModifyOrder` function with the order ticket and new stop loss and take profit levels.

Finally, it closes the order by calling the `CloseOrder` function with the order ticket.
